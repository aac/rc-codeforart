## Recurse Center - Code for Art

This repo contains starter code for making art (or at least doing visual things) with code, using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).

If you have git on your machine, clone this repo with:

```tktktk```

The repo contains an HTML file, `index.html`, which contains a canvas element and includes the Javascript files for p5. It also loads `sketch.js`, which contains our code for interacting with p5 and drawing things in the canvas element.

To see the output of your code, just load index.html in your web browser. (On macOS you can do that from the CLI by entering `open index.html` inside the git repo directory.)

p5.js has a lot of awesome functionality that I won't cover exhaustively. Check out [the reference page](https://p5js.org/reference/) for the full list of included features.
